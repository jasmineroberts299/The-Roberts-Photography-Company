<h3>Welcome to our History page.</h3>
<p>We were founded in 1815, when The Robert family consisted of painters and sculpters. Bill Robert, who was the head of the family, thought that it would be a great idea to create a machine that captured photographic stills of moments instead of having to use paint and clay to reenact those moments. He called it "The Picture Thingy". It was a big machine that stood on 3 legs and you had to put your head under a hood and hold a light with one arm. This was the original camera before the patented camera was made in 1816.</p>
<p>Since then, each generation of the Robert family have been going to school for photography and continuing the legacy.</p>
